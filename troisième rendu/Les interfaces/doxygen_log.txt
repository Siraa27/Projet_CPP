You can use doxygen in a number of ways:

1) Use doxygen to generate a template configuration file:
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen [-s] -g [configName]

2) Use doxygen to update an old configuration file:
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen [-s] -u [configName]

3) Use doxygen to generate documentation using an existing configuration file:
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen [configName]

4) Use doxygen to generate a template file controlling the layout of the
   generated documentation:
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -l [layoutFileName]

    In case layoutFileName is omitted layoutFileName.xml will be used as filename.
    If - is used for layoutFileName doxygen will write to standard output.

5) Use doxygen to generate a template style sheet file for RTF, HTML or Latex.
    RTF:        /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -w rtf styleSheetFile
    HTML:       /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -w html headerFile footerFile styleSheetFile [configFile]
    LaTeX:      /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -w latex headerFile footerFile styleSheetFile [configFile]

6) Use doxygen to generate a rtf extensions file
    RTF:   /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -e rtf extensionsFile

    If - is used for extensionsFile doxygen will write to standard output.

7) Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template configuration file
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -x [configFile]

8) Use doxygen to show a list of built-in emojis.
    /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/doxygen -f emoji outputFileName

    If - is used for outputFileName doxygen will write to standard output.

If -s is specified the comments of the configuration items in the config file will be omitted.
If configName is omitted 'Doxyfile' will be used as a default.
If - is used for configFile doxygen will write / read the configuration to /from standard output / input.
